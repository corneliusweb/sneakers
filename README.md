## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Extra Features
- Products are rendered dynamically, **NOT** hard-coded. The data lives in `./src/constants/index.ts`
- By simply adding other **Product objects** to the array, you'll have multiple products rendered with individual states.
- Users can add, and manage multiple products in their cart.
- This project features many reusable components. Therefore, future expansion/completion is made easy.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript v5.8.3](https://typescript.org) - A JavaScript subset
- [Tailwindcss v4.1](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to leverage on `useContext` to provide, and access values across the entire product.

This project also thought me the importance of building a product from the visionary point of view. What this means is that, I built this project by have in mind, the possibility of wanting to expand this project later on in my learning journey, which made me to build it in that respect.

This project also helped me to build my TypeScript muscle memory and practice type safety as much as possible.

### Continued development

I am 100% positive that I want to extend this project in the nearest future. I want to build the page for all of the links in the top navigation.

Due to the structuring of the project, building the remaining pages will be very easy and a cool experience. I just can't wait to work on this as soon as I can.
